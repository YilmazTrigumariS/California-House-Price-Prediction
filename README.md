# California-House-Price-Prediction

Analysis by: Yilmaz Trigumari Syah Putra

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices in California using machine learning models. The goal is to develop an accurate price prediction system based on various features such as location, median income, number of rooms, and house age. By analyzing patterns in the housing market, this study aims to provide insights into factors that influence house prices.

## Business Understanding
The real estate market in California is highly dynamic, with prices influenced by multiple factors. Understanding the key drivers of house prices can help:
1. Home Buyers & Investors: Make informed decisions based on market trends.
2. Real Estate Agents: Provide better price estimations for clients.
3. Urban Planners: Identify areas with high housing demand.

# Project Goals
1. Develop a robust machine learning model to improve the accuracy of house price predictions.
2. Optimize model performance through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to enhance predictive capabilities.
3. Compare machine learning predictions with a rule-based approach to assess improvements and reliability.
